    "Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes or properties) and methods (functions or procedures) that operate on that data into a single unit called a class.\n",
    "It enforces access control, which means that the internal state of an object can only be modified through defined methods, and the data is hidden from the outside world.\n",
    "This helps in achieving data integrity and reduces the risk of unintended interference with the object's internal state.\n",
    "Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors (attributes and methods) from an existing class (base class or superclass).\n",
    "It promotes code reusability and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.\n",
    "Subclasses can extend or override the functionality of their parent classes, adding or modifying behaviors as needed.\n",
    "Abstraction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction involves simplifying complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential attributes and behaviors relevant to the problem domain.\n",
    "It allows you to focus on what an object does rather than how it does it.\n",
    "Abstract classes and interfaces are used to define a blueprint for classes, specifying the methods that must be implemented by concrete (derived) classes.\n",
    "Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism means \"many shapes\" and refers to the ability of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass.\n",
    "It enables you to write code that can work with objects of multiple classes in a unified way.\n",
    "Polymorphism is often achieved through method overriding (where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method defined in its superclass) and method overloading (where multiple methods with the same name exist in a class, but they differ in terms of parameters or types).\n",
    "These four pillars of OOP help software developers create modular, maintainable, and extensible code by promoting concepts such as reusability, modularity, and separation of concerns."
